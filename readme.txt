Readme Notes:

You need to have node.js, mongoDB, and npm installed.

To install mongoose, you need to run:

> npm install

in the directory where main.js and
the package.json files live.

After running npm install, you should 
have a node_modules subdirectory

Now call program from the command shell with a cat name.
For example:

> node main.js morris


When you run the program again, you'll see the cat you
saved the last time around in the listing of all cats saved.
